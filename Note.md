# Route handlers

- Custom request route handler
- For Restful endpoints
- No need for separate servers
- Methods [GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD & OPTIONS]
- 405 is returned for unsupported response
- Always watch out for conflict between route handler and page route. To fix create an api subdirectory
